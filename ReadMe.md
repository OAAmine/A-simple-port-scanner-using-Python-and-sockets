# Simple Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanner implemented in Python. It scans a specified IP address for open ports within a given range.

## How it Works

The port scanner iterates over a specified range of ports and attempts to establish a TCP connection to each port on the target IP address. If the connection is successful, the port is considered open, and it is added to the list of open ports.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the IP address you want to scan when prompted.
3. Enter the port range in the format `min_port-max_port` when prompted.
4. The script will output a list of open ports on the specified IP address.
